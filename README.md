### Project Description
[CodeQuest is a beginner-friendly, game-based learning platform that helps students learn programming through interactive escape-room style challenges.
Users unlock doors by solving coding questions, predicting outputs, or typing code, while a timer, score system, hints, and limited attempts make learning fun and engaging.]

### The Problem statement
[Many beginners struggle to learn programming due to a lack of interactive, beginner-friendly learning platforms that make coding engaging and less intimidating. CodeQuest aims to solve this by providing a game-based learning experience where users learn programming concepts through escape-room style challenges, improving understanding, motivation, and consistency in learning.]

### The Solution
[The CodeQuest game is designed like an escape-room challenge where the player must unlock a door to complete each level. When the game starts, the player is placed inside a room and a locked door is shown on the screen. To open this door, the player must obtain a key, which can only be earned by answering a programming question correctly. The questions can be in different formats such as a multiple-choice quiz, predicting the output of a given code, or typing a small piece of code. As soon as the game begins, a timer starts running and the total time taken to complete the level is recorded. The player is given three chances to answer the question. If the player gives an incorrect answer on the first or second attempt, the score is reduced by two points for each wrong attempt, but the game continues. If the player fails to answer correctly within all three attempts, the level is marked as failed and the door remains locked. If the correct answer is given within the allowed chances, the player successfully collects the key, the door opens, and the level is completed. A hint option is also available during the game for players who are stuck, allowing them to get guidance to solve the question. At the end of the level, the game displays the final score along with the total time taken, giving the player a clear idea of their performance before moving on to the next level]
